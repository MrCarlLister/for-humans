tip-list:
  - body: >-
      The words you use on your buttons can make or break a customers
      engagement.


      The following are all content changes, so you can make these changes without a developer's help
    title: Let's begin
  - title: 1. Use action words
    body: Use verbs like \*\*Reserve\*\*, \*\*Get\*\*, \*\*Buy\*\* and \*\*Join\*\*.
      These words are more engaging than generic terms like “Submit” or
      “Subscribe” and give the user a clearer picture of what will happen when
      they click the button.
  - title: 2. Be transparent
    body: >-
      Don't hide your important links within paragraphs, give them a beautiful
      button.


      Couple your verb or action words with clear information. So instead of simply **Join** a better button might read **Join the UX group**
  - body: "\"Urgency\" is about being transparent (and honest) about how limiting
      the action is. For instance, if it's the day before an event you might use
      **Book your spot – only 2 left**"
    title: 3. Create urgency
